This is an exercise in UX, to try and establish good patterns
for selection of options, as well as layout of forms and pages
within collections.

The basic idea is to dynamically alter the representation of the
interface based on the size of the input or selection data.

I'm focusing on selecting options first, with the intention of
scaling up to layout of forms, and then onto layout of forms
within collections, as well as collections within tabular
and paginated layouts.

The end result should be an interface which adapts to the data,
providing an optimal viewing/editing experience based on the size
of the data being viewed.
